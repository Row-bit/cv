          <em>Student at McMaster University & Aspiring <strong>Web Developer</strong>.</em>
        </p>
        <p>I am an undergraduate student studying Economics and Finance at McMaster University, Ontario, Canada. I really
          love studying Economics. I am more into the use of statistical methods to interpret and model different Economic
          models. Statistics is a great tool to understand different macroeconomic as well as microeconomic principles governing the world economy.
          This inspired me to learn more about data science and the use of different statistical softwares like MATLAB and programming languages like R and python
          to excel in this field. I am also a technology loving person since it has almost become an integral part of today's society. So, this continuously keeps pushing me to learn
          those skills which are particularly not covered by the formal education. So, for over two years I have developed
          a great passion for web development and UX/UI designing and I am still in the process of becoming a full-fledged skilled developer.</p>
